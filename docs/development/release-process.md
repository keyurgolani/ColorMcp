# Release Process Guide

This document outlines the complete release process for MCP Color Server, including versioning strategy, quality gates, and deployment procedures.

## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning

MCP Color Server follows [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) with the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes, API incompatibilities
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New features, backward-compatible additions
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, security patches, backward-compatible changes

### Version Examples

```
0.1.0     - Initial development release
0.2.0     - New color format support (minor)
0.2.1     - Bug fix in color conversion (patch)
2.0.0     - Breaking API changes (major)
2.0.0-rc.1 - Release candidate
2.1.0-beta.1 - Beta version with new features
```

### Pre-release Versions

- **Alpha** (`0.1.0-alpha.1`): Early development, unstable
- **Beta** (`0.1.0-beta.1`): Feature-complete, testing phase

npm publish

# Create GitHub release (automated in CI)
gh release create v1.2.0 \
  --title "Release v1.2.0" \
  --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES.md \
  --verify-tag
```
