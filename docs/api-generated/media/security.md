## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of MCP Color Server seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@mcp-color-server.org**

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Measures

### Input Validation

MCP Color Server implements comprehensive input validation:

- **Color Format Validation**: All color inputs are validated against known safe formats
- **Parameter Bounds Checking**: Numeric parameters are checked for valid ranges
- **URL Sanitization**: Image URLs are validated and sanitized before processing
- **File Type Validation**: Uploaded files are checked for valid image types
- **Size Limits**: All inputs have appropriate size limits to prevent resource exhaustion

### Output Sanitization

- **HTML Generation**: All generated HTML is sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- **CSS Generation**: Generated CSS is validated to prevent code injection
- **SVG Sanitization**: SVG outputs are sanitized to remove potentially malicious content
- **Base64 Validation**: All base64 encoded outputs are validated for integrity

### Resource Protection

- **Memory Limits**: Operations are limited to prevent memory exhaustion (100MB per request)
- **Processing Timeouts**: Long-running operations have timeouts to prevent resource hogging
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting for expensive operations
- **Concurrent Request Limits**: Maximum concurrent requests are limited

### Secure Dependencies

- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are regularly updated to patch security vulnerabilities
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Minimal Dependencies**: We use minimal, well-maintained dependencies to reduce attack surface
- **License Compliance**: All dependencies are checked for license compatibility

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Server Deployment

When deploying MCP Color Server in production:

1. **Network Security**
   - Run behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache)
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Limit network access to necessary ports only

2. **Process Security**
   - Run the server with minimal privileges
   - Use a dedicated user account for the server process
   - Implement proper logging and monitoring
   - Set up log rotation to prevent disk space issues

3. **Resource Limits**
   - Configure appropriate memory limits
   - Set CPU usage limits
   - Implement disk space monitoring
   - Use process managers (PM2, systemd) for automatic restarts

4. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all inputs at the application layer
   - Implement additional rate limiting if needed
   - Monitor for suspicious activity patterns
   - Log security-relevant events

### Client Integration

When integrating with MCP Color Server:

1. **Authentication**
   - Implement proper authentication mechanisms
   - Use secure communication channels
   - Validate server responses
   - Handle errors gracefully

2. **Data Handling**
   - Validate all data received from the server
   - Sanitize outputs before displaying to users
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Log security events appropriately

## Known Security Considerations

### Image Processing

- **File Size Limits**: Large image files can consume significant memory
- **File Type Validation**: Only specific image formats are supported
- **Processing Timeouts**: Image processing operations have timeouts
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of image processing resources

### Color Calculations

- **Precision Limits**: Mathematical operations are limited to prevent overflow
- **Input Validation**: All color values are validated for valid ranges
- **Algorithm Safety**: Color algorithms are designed to handle edge cases safely

### Visualization Generation

- **HTML Sanitization**: All generated HTML is sanitized
- **CSS Validation**: Generated CSS is validated for safety
- **Resource Limits**: Visualization generation has memory and time limits
- **Output Validation**: All outputs are validated before returning

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

1. **Initial Report**: Vulnerability reported via email
2. **Acknowledgment**: We acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
3. **Investigation**: We investigate and validate the vulnerability (1-7 days)
4. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix (1-14 days depending on severity)
5. **Release**: We release a patched version
6. **Public Disclosure**: We publicly disclose the vulnerability after users have had time to update (typically 30 days after release)

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and are clearly marked in the changelog. We recommend:

- Subscribe to release notifications on GitHub
- Regularly update to the latest version
- Review security advisories before updating
- Test updates in a staging environment first
